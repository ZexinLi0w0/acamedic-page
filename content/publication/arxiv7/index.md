abstract: "Deep Research Agents (DRAs) generate citation-rich reports via multi-step search and synthesis, yet existing benchmarks mainly target text-only settings or short-form multimodal question answering, missing end-to-end multimodal evidence use. We introduce MMDeepResearch-Bench (MMDR-Bench), a benchmark of 140 expert-crafted tasks across 21 domains, where each task provides an image--text bundle to evaluate multimodal understanding and citation-grounded report generation. We further propose a unified, interpretable evaluation pipeline: FLAE (Formula--LLM Adaptive Evaluation), a formula--LLM hybrid combining reproducible text features with task-adaptive judging for report quality; TRACE (Trustworthy Retrieval-Aligned Citation Evaluation), which verifies Claim--URL support and enforces multimodal prompt faithfulness via visual evidence fidelity; and MOSAIC (Multimodal Support-Aligned Integrity Check), which checks integrity between visual-referenced statements and visual artifacts. Experiments on 25 state-of-the-art models reveal clear trade-offs between generation quality and multimodal grounding. A human study shows strong alignment with expert judgments. MMDR-Bench and the associated evaluation framework will be publicly available after acceptance."
