We present PIMbot, an approach to manipulate the reward function in multi-robot collaboration through two distinct forms: policy and incentive manipulation. PIMBot introduces a new angle for manipulating multi-agent RL social dilemmas through a unique reward function for incentivization. By using our proposed mechanisms, a robot is able to manipulate the social dilemma environment effectively.
